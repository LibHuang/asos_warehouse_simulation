# ASOS Warehouse Simulation

Summary: ASOS Inventory & Demand Forecast Platform

The purpose of this project is to build a modular, end‑to‑end data pipeline to support real‑time inventory tracking, demand forecasting, and ensure resource optimization for the highest profit margins.
I'm attempting to simulate a Snowflake production pipeline at a retail company. I built raw-to-curated zone transformations using dbt and Snowflake SQL. It supports daily sales reporting and customer segmentation, and I will load in more features as they come.
